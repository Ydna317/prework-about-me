      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am studying to become a software engineer. I had spent the last half decade working for The Walt Disney Company until the firenation attacked. Damn you, Covid-19.
        Now, I am on a journey to pursue the knowledge and know how in order to devote myself to the works of Blizzard, Square-Enix, or Walt Disney Imagineering.
      </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born in Vietnam in a small province called, "Binh Duong," but have been raised in California since 1996.
      </p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I have far too many details to list, but below are just a few and my most active interests.
        <ul> <li> 
          Road Cycling
        </li> <li>
          Magic The Gathering
        </li> <li>
          Video Games
        </li></ul>
      </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job would be working on a franchise that helped build my childhood. I would love the opportunity to be on the creative team for Blizzard's Diablo, Square-Enix's
        Final Fantasy, or becoming a Walt Disney Imagineer.
      </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in Irvine, California. This seems ideal for someone who wants to become a software engineer for Blizzard, Disney, or Square Enix, right?</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I find myself on the computer for more than six hours a day. Why not make something of it? At the same time, I love the aspect of coding and the challenges it produces.
        This is what I want to do and I have quickly found a passion for it through the prework provided by the UCI Coding Bootcamp.
